## üßê What is this?

Every developer has a story. It's written in every commit, every branch, every late-night bug fix, and every triumphant merge. GitGlyph reads that story and translates it into a visual language.

Your Glyph is your digital fingerprint. It's a non-static image that grows and changes as you continue to code. It's a new way to appreciate the effort, rhythm, and structure of your work, and to share that story with others in a form that anyone can find beautiful. We handle the complex algorithms and browser rendering so you can focus on the art of your code.

## üöÄ Features

*   **üé® Personal Generative Art:** Connect your GitHub or GitLab account and instantly generate a unique "Glyph" from your personal commit history.
*   **‚ú® Dynamic & Evolving:** Your Glyph is alive! New branches create intricate new patterns, while your commit frequency and the size of your changes alter the colors, shapes, and textures of your artwork.
*   **üèõÔ∏è Collaborative Glyphs:** Generate a single, unified Glyph for a team project or an entire organization. Visualize the collective effort, see who the key contributors are, and watch the project's pulse.
*   **ü§ù Social & Shareable:** Share your Glyph with friends and colleagues. Compare your coding styles, see the visual story of their work, and connect on a whole new creative level.
*   **üñºÔ∏è Showcase Your Work:** Get a shareable link or an embeddable widget for your Glyph. Add it to your personal website, portfolio, or GitHub profile to display a unique visual signature of your coding journey.
*   **üèéÔ∏è Performant & Web-Native:** Experience intricate, animated visuals rendered smoothly and efficiently, right in your web browser. No plugins, no heavy downloads.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Ready to create your own Glyph? It's simple to get started.

1.  **Visit our Platform:**
    Navigate to **[GitGlyph.com](https://www.example.com)** (link is for demonstration) and click "Sign Up".

2.  **Connect Your Account:**
    Choose to connect with either your GitHub or GitLab account. We use a secure OAuth flow and only request **read-access to your commit metadata** (like timestamps, branch names, and commit messages). We **never** access your code.

3.  **Generate Your Glyph:**
    Once connected, select the repositories you want to include and hit "Generate My Glyph!". Our engine will analyze your history and render your first masterpiece. This may take a few moments depending on the size of your history.

4.  **Explore and Share!**
    Your Glyph is ready! Explore its patterns, watch its animation, and see the story of your work unfold. Grab the share link and show it to the world!

### The Magic Behind the Glyph (How it Works)

Curious about how we turn data into art? Our algorithms map different aspects of your version control history to aesthetic properties:

*   **üå≥ Branching & Merging:** Every `git branch` sprouts a new limb or pattern in your Glyph. A `git merge` beautifully intertwines those patterns, creating a record of collaboration.
*   **üé® Commit Frequency & Size:** A flurry of commits might create a burst of vibrant color, while larger, more substantial commits could influence the size and weight of shapes.
*   **üï∞Ô∏è Time & Consistency:** The time of day or the regularity of your commits can subtly influence the hue, saturation, and texture of the artwork, revealing the rhythm of your workflow.
